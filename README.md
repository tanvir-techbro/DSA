# DSA

This is my collection of DSA (Data Structure and Algorithm) I learned. I'll update the repo and add new files whenever I learn a new algorithm.

You can check out the algorithms by cloning this repo or by downloading files.

###command to clone this repo

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tanvir-techbro/DSA.git
```
Then you can compile the files and run using C++ compiler.
